This code doesn't work as fast as we would like. Can you make it 3 times faster,
while having exactly the same input ? (in the same order).

Constraint: you can not use more than one core or processor.

Evaluation will be based on the nature of the changes in the code, more than on
the execution speed (as long as the program runs in the required time).

Running:
--------

# PHP:
time php test1.php ./words < test1.in > test1.out
# Go:
time go run test1.go ./words < test1.in > test1.out
# NodeJS:
time node test1.go ./words < test1.in > test1.out

# Check output:
diff -u test1.exp test1.out && echo OK
